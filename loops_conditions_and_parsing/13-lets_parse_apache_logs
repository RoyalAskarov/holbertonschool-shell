# This script parses an Apache access log file to display only the IP address and HTTP status code using awk.

# The Apache log file will be provided to the script (e.g., via cat, a pipe, or direct file access in awk).
# Assuming the access log data is either piped into the script or supplied as an argument.
# Based on the example provided in the task description:
# IP address is the first field ($1)
# HTTP status code is the ninth field ($9)

awk '{print $1, $9}' apache-access.log
